				<h3>Who We are</h3>
				<p>Kindness is at the heart of everything we do – but – we’re about so much more. With the aim of creating skincare that
					is fuss-free and approachable, we’re committed to keeping you and your skin looking (and feeling!) its best, starting
					with clean, uncomplicated products that downright love your skin and the planet too.
					Our journey started way back in the 1960’s, in the hands of a British doctor, with the goal of offering kindness to
					sensitive skins. With 1978 marking the launch of our first ever no colour, no perfume and no harsh chemicals soap,
					our attitude towards skincare is still the same! Meaning your skin will love us, always.</p>

			<h3>We are free from</h3>
			<p>Our free-from list boasts more than 2000 harsh chemicals that are harmful to your skin! But we don’t stop there, we are
			committed to clean beauty and for that, every year 10% of our profits go towards R&D. These efforts are to further work
			on our free-from list and increase the number of blacklisted ingredients. Oh yes, we take a lot of pride in this
			ever-increasing list!</p>

			products too . Call us obsessed but that how we make sure they are nothing but kind skin loving and safe especially for
			sensitive skin so we put them through the wringer to make sure that they come out skin loving on the other side</p>

			<h3>The Reason to believe in us</h3>
			<p>How do I know if a brand follows clean beauty? Does natural mean clean beauty? What exactly are the ingredients to look
			for? And many more questions are asked! But is clean beauty really that complicated? Moreover, does it NEED to be that
			complicated? NO! Clean Beauty Is Simple!</p>

	<p class="last">We think looking after your skin should be simple, clean and free from any harsh ingredients that could upset it. Which
	is why we only use the kindest ingredients that respect your skin’s natural ways.
	The world of skincare is always evolving, and we’re always learning. Our goal is to make sure we keep up-to-date on
	innovations, our free-from list (which already contains more than 2000 chemicals!) and committing to kindness, always.</p>
